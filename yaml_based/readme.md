# FILL ME IN


## Current workflow

- Manually update `base.yaml`
- Run `convert.py` to generate a new `index.html` based on `template.html` and content in `base.yaml`
- Run `prep_for_render_cv.py` to create a processed yaml file, `cv_pubs.yaml`, which will be manually copied to the `Nicholas_Vincent_CV.yaml` file (rendercv is intentionally opinionated about key names, etc)


## Things in the rendercv folder that are NOT in base.yaml

- Reviewing
- mentoring

### Things in the details.yaml file

- Book chapter
- additional affiliations
